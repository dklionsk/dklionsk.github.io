    <p>Hi, I'm <b>David Klionsky</b>.</p>
    <p>I'm a software engineer with a passion for education, AI, and building apps that people love.</p>
    <p>I'm currently working on <a href="https://playscoutapp.com/">PlayScout</a>, an app for helping families find great playgrounds.</p>
    <p>Previously, I was employee #12 at Duolingo, where I was the sole engineer who built <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/duolingo-learn-languages-for/id570060128?mt=8">Duolingo for iOS</a>.</p>
    <p>I also co-led the team that built <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/abc">Duolingo ABC</a>, making early literacy accessible to families everywhere.</p>
